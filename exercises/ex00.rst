Exersice 0:
===========

Before we start the exersices, you must prepare the exersice repository.
There are a number of files you should modify to do this. Do this in a
separate branch, named ``ex00`` and submit a Pull request to merge with
``master``.

 * Fill in the ``readme.rst`` file (i.e. replace FIRSTNAME with your first name
   and SURNAME with your surname)
 * Fill in the ``setup.cfg`` file (i.e. replace FIRSTNAME with your first name,
   SURNAME with your surname, and your@email.no with your email adress)
 * Change the name of the ``YOUR_NAME_ex`` folder to be the same as the name
   you set for your project in setup.cfg

   * Example: "yngve_moe_ex"
   * Note that there are no capital letters here.
